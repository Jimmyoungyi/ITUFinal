Typically made from cowâ€™s milk, this semi-hard cheese is characterized by its aromatic and caramel-like flavor combined with its dense and springy texture. Hints of nuts with sweet and creamy notes embrace your palate in a graceful sensation and, depending on the age, the finish ranges from smooth to sharp.",
            "In all aspects, Cheddar boasts immense versatility, meaning that the process of making it has endured many adoptions and variations. Common to all, however, is the process known as Cheddaring, in which loaves of curd are stacked on top of one another, causing excess whey to drain off. It is during this continual layering that the cheese begins to develop its characteristic flavor and texture.\n" +
